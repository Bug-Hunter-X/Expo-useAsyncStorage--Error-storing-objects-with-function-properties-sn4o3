This bug occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook with a complex object. The issue arises when the object contains a function as one of its properties.  When attempting to store the object, the function is not properly serialized, causing an error.  The error message might vary depending on the context and implementation details of the storage mechanism, but typically, it involves problems related to unsupported data types.
